# Deep Learning Models for Energy Load Forecasting: A Comparative Study of LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Autoencoder Architectures


Accurate prediction of building energy consumption is critical for efficient energy management and sustainability. In this study, the effectiveness of deep learning architectures, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), and their variants integrated with autoencoders were investigated for time series forecasting of building energy demand. Sequence to one forecasting using a 24 hour window was applied and the models performance evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and R². The results show that the CNN-LSTM model achieved the best performance (MAE = 40.98, RMSE = 81.50, R² = 0.20), outperforming both standard LSTM and autoencoder based models. While autoencoders were used for feature reduction to potentially enhance learning efficiency, their integration however led to performance degradation, likely due to the loss of temporal resolution. Compared to previous studies that used traditional machine learning methods, the deep learning approach demonstrates competitive performance and highlights the value of convolutional feature extraction in sequence modeling. This research underscores the importance of model selection and input representation in time series forecasting tasks for smart energy systems.
